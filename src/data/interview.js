        content: `First of all, let me tell you about myself.
        I am a front-end JavaScript developer with 10 years of experience.       
       I specialize in Web and Decentralized applications, and in addition to front-end development, I am interested in Web Design, back-end development and GraphQL.       
        My great performances are in TypeScript, JavaScript and its libraries and such as Angular, React, Redux, Web3.js, etc.       
       I also have strong knowledge in Data Structure & Algorithm, which always helps me build robust and high-performance applications.
       My software developer career was started when I was a university student at the California State University – Los Angeles.
       You know who I'm envious of? People who work in a job that has to do with their college major.
       When I was a sophomore, I really loved art and design and I wanted to get a job for both art and science.
       I was selected as one of the internships at Enplug for later frontend position. They were recruiting employees extensively due the company had been founded in 2012.
       So, after the graduation from the university, I started working there located in Los Angeles at a junior position and promoted as a senior developer two years later.
       I could have clear understandings of modern Front-end technologies and best design practices there.       
       That was my meaningful start in the software developers’ world.
       Later my skills expanded amazingly, especially in MERN stack. I have built over 30 websites using this stack in 2018.
       Regarding the knowledge of MERN Stack, all my development in React takes place on the front-end, I have switched to writing cascading styles in CSSinJS and also migrated my know-how to the React context. In the back-end I use Node.js and Serverless technology.
       I think those are my proudest achievements in my life as a software developer.
       However, on Jan 2020, as if it was a challenge against my life, I had to quit the company due to the pandemic.
       At that time, I preferred working from home, but the company asked me to commute to work.
       
       After that, I started finding a remote job, and succeeded joining loanDepot company in Lake Forest, CA.
       I was not only frontend developer, but also a designer for data visualization and analysis as a senior full stack JavaScript developer.
       And it was crucial for me to see that someone was keen to use. In that case, I didn’t even care that I had been coding in these languages for ten years or even more.
       Because the successful result doesn't come only from the experience.
       Ten years’ experience of my awesome knowledge is never important for users to use their products, but the result is much more important.
       So, I worked as agile as possible and maintained positive and happy client relationships with 20 corporate customers.
       You know it's blockchain winter now and the company can't afford to provide me more works. That's why they asked me to find a new work.
       I had to stop working under the trouble of my company and it made me move into a new freelancers’ world. So now I am working as a freelancer for about 3 months.
       Actually, I am free now and can start a new work immediately.
       That's all.`

        I love everything about the company and really enjoyed working there. But reality made me look for new opportunities to achieve my goals.

        At first, one of my managers was visibly upset. I quickly realized that I hadn’t done a good enough job of explaining the situation. I quickly asked to meet one-on-one and told the manager why I didn’t have as much time available as he thought. He immediately understood and I was able to avoid a bigger conflict.
        
        It turned out that neither manager realized how busy I was. They ended up speaking with each other and coming up with a plan that would lighten my workload so that I could continue to perform the most important tasks for both of them.`

I can work hard and consistently to achieve a goal if that helps me in growing and learning. I can motivate myself to do a task even when there are multiple obstacles and I can complete it.
        However, my weakness is being over self-motivated because in that process I lose myself and get too goal oriented. If it is a team task then my self-goals become a burden for them and as a result, I come across clashes and group breakdowns sometimes.
        I have been working on this for the last few months where I set a limit for myself and for the team and try not to affect my goals and objectives becomes a pressure for the others.
